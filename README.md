# A/B Testing (Payment type vs Fare amount)
For detail analysis: 

## I. Problem Context
You are a data professional in a data analytics firm, called Automatidata. The company's newest client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC) requested a detailed statistical analysis of payment type. That is, do the customers who use a credit card pay higher fare amounts than those who use cash?

That said, the TLC team is asking us to consider the following:

- The relationship between fare amount and payment type.
- Test the hypothesis that customers who use a credit card pay higher fare amounts.
- Should you conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between credit card payment and fare amount, discuss what the next steps should be: what are your thoughts on strategies our team could implement to encourage customers to pay with credit card?


## II. Project Goal

- Analyze the relationship between total fare amount and payment type
- Sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and total fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher total fare amounts than customers who use cash.
- Should you conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between credit card payment and total fare amount, discuss what the next steps should be: what are your thoughts on strategies to encourage customers to pay with credit card if the difference is significant?

- Explain result to stakeholders who may not be familiar with analytics


## III. Data Source

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day.

Remark: For the purpose of this project, assume that the sample data comes from an experiment in which customers are randomly selected and divided into two groups:

customers who are required to pay with credit card
customers who are required to pay with cash
Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.
