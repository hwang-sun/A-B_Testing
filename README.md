# A/B Testing (Payment type vs Fare amount)
For detail analysis: 

## I. Problem Context
You are a data professional in a data analytics firm, called Automatidata. The company's newest client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC) requested a detailed statistical analysis of payment type. That is, do the customers who use a credit card pay higher fare amounts than those who use cash?

That said, the TLC team is asking us to consider the following:

- The relationship between fare amount and payment type.
- Test the hypothesis that customers who use a credit card pay higher fare amounts.
- Should you conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between credit card payment and fare amount, discuss what the next steps should be: what are your thoughts on strategies our team could implement to encourage customers to pay with credit card?


## II. Project Goal

The main purpose of this project is to Sample and analyze data to discover whether there is a relationship between payment type and total fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher total fare amounts than customers who use cash. Strategies can be made based on the result in order to find ways to generate more revenue for New York City taxi cab drivers.


## III. Data Source

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day.

Remark: For the purpose of this project, assume that the sample data comes from an experiment in which customers are randomly selected and divided into two groups:

- Customers who are required to pay with credit card
- customers who are required to pay with cash

Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.


## IV. PACE Process for completing project
- Plan: conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.
  + Determine the scope of project

  + Create a workflow for completing the project
  
- Analyze: collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.
  + Exploratory data analysis
  + Data cleaning
  + Identify relationship
  
- Construct: build models that will allow you access to hidden relationships locked within data.
  + Data sampling
  + A/B test performing
  + Validity checks
  
- Execute: present the finding of your analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.
  + Insight conclusion
  + Recommendations
  + Analysis drawbacks
